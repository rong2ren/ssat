# First shot 

# Start with RAG
Build a knowledge base of validated questions
Implement semantic search for example retrieval

Costs: ~$100/month (FAISS + embeddings)

# Fine-Tuning
When you have >1k high-quality questions, progress to fine-tuning.
Use OpenAI's fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 (~$500 initial cost)

Maintain RAG for dynamic updates


# Long term
RAG for example retrieval + fine-tuned model for generation
