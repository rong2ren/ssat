Passage: The phenomenon of bioluminescence, the production and emission of light by living organisms, has fascinated scientists for centuries. This remarkable ability occurs through a chemical reaction involving luciferin, a light-emitting compound, and luciferase, an enzyme. The reaction requires oxygen and produces light with minimal heat generation, making it far more efficient than human-made light sources. Various marine organisms, including jellyfish, deep-sea fish, and plankton, utilize bioluminescence for communication, predator avoidance, and prey attraction.

Question: Based on the passage, what makes bioluminescence more efficient than human-made light?
Choices: A) It uses luciferin compound, B) It requires oxygen to function, C) It produces minimal heat, D) It occurs in marine organisms
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The passage states that bioluminescence "produces light with minimal heat generation, making it far more efficient than human-made light sources."
