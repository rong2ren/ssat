# Health Check Improvements

## Overview

The health check endpoints have been simplified to focus on essential functionality while following Supabase best practices.

## Health Check Endpoints

### 1. Main Application Health Check (`/health`)

**Endpoint:** `GET /health`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive health check for the entire SSAT Question Generator API

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy|unhealthy",
  "message": "Status description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T01:24:52.635388",
  "database_connected": true
}
```

**Health Checks Performed:**
1. **Database Connection** - Tests connectivity to Supabase database (the only critical dependency)

### 2. Authentication Service Health Check (`/auth/health`)

**Endpoint:** `GET /auth/health`

**Purpose:** Specific health check for authentication service

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy|unhealthy",
  "message": "Authentication service status",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T01:24:58.162387"
}
```

**Health Checks Performed:**
1. **Database Connectivity** - Tests database table access (the only critical dependency for auth)

## Supabase Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Focused Service Testing
- Tests only critical dependencies (database connectivity)
- Avoids expensive operations that could slow down health checks
- Provides clear pass/fail status

### 2. Essential Health Information
- Includes timestamp for monitoring
- Provides clear status message
- Simple and fast response

### 3. Proper Error Handling
- Graceful error handling with logging
- Non-blocking health checks
- Clear error messages

### 4. Standardized Response Format
- Consistent JSON structure
- Clear status indicators
- Minimal overhead

## Usage Examples

### Check Main API Health
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Check Authentication Service Health
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/auth/health
```

### Monitor Health in Production
```bash
# Check every 30 seconds
watch -n 30 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/health | jq .'

# Check auth service specifically
watch -n 30 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/auth/health | jq .'
```

## Health Status Meanings

- **healthy**: Critical dependencies are functioning normally
- **unhealthy**: Critical dependencies are down, API may not be functional

## Monitoring Integration

These health checks can be integrated with:
- Load balancers for automatic failover
- Monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
- Container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- CI/CD pipelines for deployment validation

## Why Simplified Health Checks?

The health checks were simplified because:

1. **Performance** - Complex health checks can slow down the endpoint
2. **Reliability** - Fewer dependencies mean fewer failure points
3. **Simplicity** - Easier to understand and maintain
4. **Focus** - Tests only what's truly critical for the service to function

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Add uptime tracking
2. Include basic performance metrics
3. Add memory usage monitoring
4. Add custom health check endpoints for specific features (if needed)
